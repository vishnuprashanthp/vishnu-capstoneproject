                <p>We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or
                  discontinuance of the Service.</p>

                <h2>SECTION 5 - PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (if applicable)</h2>
                <p>Certain products or Services may be available exclusively online through the website. These products
                  or Services may have limited quantities and are subject to return or exchange only according to our
                  Return Policy. To view our Return Policy, please visit [LINK TO RETURN POLICY]</p>

                <p>We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or Services to any
                  person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We
